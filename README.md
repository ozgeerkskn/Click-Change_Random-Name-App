# Click-Change_Random-Name-App

Application Overview:
This application is a random name generator developed using Node.js and Express.js. With a click of a button, the application selects random words from two different arrays named "isim" and "adjective," combines them, and thus creates a random name. The application provides users with a different name on each click in a simple and entertaining manner.

Technological Infrastructure:

Node.js and Express.js: The application is developed on the server side using Node.js, leveraging the lightweight and flexible web application framework Express.js. This allows for the efficient handling of HTTP requests, especially the user-triggered event of clicking the button.
